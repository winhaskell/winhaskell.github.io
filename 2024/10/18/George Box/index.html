<!--
	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!
	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:
	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/
	And a few tips on building your CSS file:
	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

<p>Box founded the UW–Madison Department of Statistics in 1960 and served as chair until 1969. “He shaped the department for the first 30 to 40 years,” says current department chair Brian Yandell. </p>

<p>博克斯于 1960 年创立了威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校统计学系，并一直担任系主任直至 1969 年。“他在最初的 30 到 40 年里塑造了这个系，”现任系主任布莱恩·扬德尔说。 </p>

			<p> “There were various statisticians of sorts scattered around the university but there was no statistics department,” recalls Norman Draper, professor emeritus of statistics and a longtime colleague of Box. “And all these separate statisticians – there were two or three in agriculture, for example – were glad to have this department started because it suddenly made statistics focused and available to all.”</p>
<p> “大学里到处都是各种各样的统计学家，但没有统计系，”统计学名誉教授、博克斯的长期同事诺曼·德雷珀回忆道。 “所有这些独立的统计学家（例如农业部门的两三位）都很高兴这个部门的成立，因为它突然使统计学变得集中并可供所有人使用。”</p>

<p>“Sometimes it would just be a good time, but other times it generated new research directions,” says Yandell. Former students have credited the sessions with teaching them as much or more than their classes.</p>
	<p>“有时这只是一个愉快的时光，但有时它会产生新的研究方向，”Yandell 说。以前的学生认为这些课程给他们带来的教益与课堂上一样多，甚至更多。 </p>
