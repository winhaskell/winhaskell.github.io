	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h1>Pi Day</h1>
			<h2>The Beauty of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Design</h2>
		</header>
		
		<p>As a math student, you learned that pi is the value that is calculated by dividing the circumference of any circle by its diameter (we typically round the value to 3.14). You will also have come across the symbol, π, in math, physics, and science classes.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why is this symbol used to represent pi? Where did it come from?</strong></h2><p>The use of pi is dated back to the Babylonians about 4,000 years ago with calculations for the area of a circle. At that time, an approximation of “3 times the square of the radius of the circle” was used, which returned a value of pi = 3. Egyptian mathematicians approximated pi with a bit more precision at 3.1605, as indicated in the <em>Rhind Papyrus</em>, which dates back to 1,650 B.C.</p><p>The Greek mathematician Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) used a visually creative approach to approximate pi by using the areas of two polygons. To envision this method, picture a polygon having so many sides that it resembles a circle in shape. With a lot of patience and grit, the area of such a polygon can be determined by constructing right triangles inside, using the <a href="https://www.mometrix.com/academy/pythagorean-theorem/">Pythagorean Theorem</a> to determine the side lengths, calculating the area of each triangle, and then adding them up.</p><p><img   alt="Pi makes a better circle by adding more sides" width="1024" height="576" data-srcset="https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-src="https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-1024x576.png" class="aligncenter wp-image-2371 size-large lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" /><noscript><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2371 size-large" src="https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-1024x576.png" alt="Pi makes a better circle by adding more sides" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.piday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Circles-1.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></noscript></p><p>Archimedes used this approach to estimate the area of the circle that could be drawn between two such polygons, with one being just smaller than the other. From there, he was able to approximate the value of pi to be between \(\frac{22}{7}\) and \(\frac{24}{7}\).</p><p>Before the pi symbol was used, pi was described as “the quantity which, when the diameter is multiplied by it, yields the circumference” and other long, roundabout descriptions.</p><p>In the 1700’s, the Swiss mathematician and physicist named Euler formalized the use of the Greek lowercase letter, π, as the notation for pi. This is the first letter of the Greek word, <em>perimetros</em>, which loosely translates to “circumference.”</p>

			<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
			<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>
			<p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
			<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>
