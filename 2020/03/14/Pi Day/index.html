	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why is this symbol used to represent pi? Where did it come from?</strong></h2>
		<p>The use of pi is dated back to the Babylonians about 4,000 years ago with calculations for the area of a circle. At that time, an approximation of “3 times the square of the radius of the circle” was used, which returned a value of pi = 3. Egyptian mathematicians approximated pi with a bit more precision at 3.1605, as indicated in the <em>Rhind Papyrus</em>, which dates back to 1,650 B.C.</p><p>The Greek mathematician Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) used a visually creative approach to approximate pi by using the areas of two polygons. To envision this method, picture a polygon having so many sides that it resembles a circle in shape. With a lot of patience and grit, the area of such a polygon can be determined by constructing right triangles inside, using the <a href="https://www.mometrix.com/academy/pythagorean-theorem/">Pythagorean Theorem</a> to determine the side lengths, calculating the area of each triangle, and then adding them up.</p>
                <p>Archimedes used this approach to estimate the area of the circle that could be drawn between two such polygons, with one being just smaller than the other. From there, he was able to approximate the value of pi to be between (22/7) and (24/7).</p>
		<p>Before the pi symbol was used, pi was described as “the quantity which, when the diameter is multiplied by it, yields the circumference” and other long, roundabout descriptions.</p><p>In the 1700’s, the Swiss mathematician and physicist named Euler formalized the use of the Greek lowercase letter, π, as the notation for pi. This is the first letter of the Greek word, <em>perimetros</em>, which loosely translates to “circumference.”</p>

	These superfluous divs/spans were originally provided as catch-alls to add extra imagery.
	These days we have full ::before and ::after support, favour using those instead.
	These only remain for historical design compatibility. They might go away one day.
