	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Introduce</h3>
			<p>Some students are primarily concerned about data ethics, others are excited about data science as a new evolution in knowledge, 
				but all are interested in how data science is changing our everyday lives.</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
			<p>The richness and importance of the information conveyed by data has led to a rapid increase in the influence of data
				on individuals and society. Data of various kinds, such as the enormous data collections on the Internet, has become
				omnipresent in virtually all aspects of our society. Digital data has become the key to innovations in both social
				and scientific domains ranging from energy, economy, health and climate to bioinformatics and web science. </p>
				

	 

		<div class="benefits" id="zen-benefits" role="article">
			<h3>About Programme</h3>
			<p> Fundamental and practical issues of the analysis of data will be addressed, including e.g. security of 
				data and software, visualization of information, decision making from data, and high performance computing algorithms.
				Data Science and Technology is meant for students who want to develop and use software that give meaning to data in 
				order to support experts from various application domains (such as economy, medicine and marketing) to better
				understand the information that they possess by means of data science techniques.</p>

	These superfluous divs/spans were originally provided as catch-alls to add extra imagery.
	These days we have full ::before and ::after support, favour using those instead.
	These only remain for historical design compatibility. They might go away one day.
