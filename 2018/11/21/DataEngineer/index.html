	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>The Road to DataEngineer Enlightenment</h3>
			<p>In this role, you will be responsible for providing accurate, timely, reliable, and ultimately useful data to the analytics group. This mandate involves everything from the discovery, access, and integration of source data into the ecosystem to guaranteeing its health and robustness within that ecosystem to modeling and presenting that data in a manner that allows stakeholders within the ecosystem to perform their duties effectively.  </p>
			<p>You will have a delicate balance in this role: you work most closely with the other members of your group and translate their needs into agile, highly-customized implementations for franchise-specific data; at the same time, though, you work just as closely with the Core Data team both to ensure that your group does not introduce problematic deviations from core data and that the core data infrastructure itself is supporting your group’s evolving needs; </p>
			<p>you are just as closely tied to the Tools and Technology team to ensure that your franchise-specific system usage is “playing nice, playing fair” within the greater analytical data ecosystem. You are one step closer to the business needs of the stakeholders and act as the primary technical resource for the franchise analytics team. Your priority is to ensure that the Analytics groups can provide best-in-class analyses, insights, and recommendations in the most timely and effective manner possible.  </p>
 <p>Our ideal candidate is the druid of the analytics space: a powerful technologist whose dedication to the craft allows him or her to morph into whatever form necessary to get the job done while retaining the flexibility to see the bigger picture and respond accordingly. </p>
<p>The ideal candidate uses the speed, agility, and targeted on-point damage of Cat form to meet the quick-shifting, high-impact immediate needs of his or her franchise group before morphing seamlessly into a Bear form, responsible for tanking the ongoing operational needs of the group as a whole. </p>
<p>A shift to Moonkin allows for the push-and-pull flow of ideas between Blizzard Analytics and Core; and the final shift to Tree provides the stability and integration between the franchise group and the other users, approaches, policies, and procedures of the overall analytical data ecosystem. </p>
